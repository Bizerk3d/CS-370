# CS-370

**Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?**

This project consisted of creating an intelligent agent to solve a maze.  We were given basics of the code, such as helper functions and the import information for the libraries, as well as the play game and build maze functions.  I was responsible for the Q-Learning algorithm to help the agent navigate the maze.

Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:

Machine learning is a rapidly expanding field that has huge ramifications on a number of aspects of computer science as the implementation of AI can change/improve many other areas of CS.

What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?

Simply put, computer scientists use technology to solve problems, create opportunities, and pave the way for the future.  It matters because as technology grows the ability for computer scientists to impact society will only continue to grow, allowing more opportunities to solve problems, create advancements, improve quality of life, and more.

How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?

Carefully approaching the problem is the first step - what am I trying to solve, and why?  Then using careful planning and pre-work to help design a solution (often consisting of an algorithm, pseudocode, diagrams, etc) before finally working to implement that solution through code.

What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?

Showing respect to both the users and the organization, such as valuing data privacy, caring for company/proprietary information, etc.  Working to create solutions that will help users and the organization, not solutions that will harm others in some way.  Also, thinking about the long-term ramifications of my actions, particularly when regarding machine learning - how could this be used incorrectly, who could it harm, was it created carefully and inclusively, etc?
